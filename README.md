# library

Vanilla stack.

The first project using constructors and more complex dom manipulation.

This is a project that I'll certainly revisit at some point.

The basic functionality is there (being able to add a book, delete it, change its haveRead status), so I'm leaving any improvements for a revisit when I'll be more versed with the tools available

Things that need improvement:
- the looks, it's pretty ugly;
- responsiveness;
- animations, currently stuff pop-up out of nowhere, don't feel confident with these as of now, will result in a huge time-sink right now;
- form validation and limitations on inputs; 
- some visual improvements, page lacks in readability when the form pops-up and there are already some cards added to the dom;
- possibly some performance improvements (at the moment even slight modifications, like changing the haveRead status, or deleting a book, require whole display to be generated from the start, haven't figured out any other solution so far).
